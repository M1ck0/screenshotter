# About

Takes screeshots of screen every **X seconds**, stores them in folder in the active directory.

### Note
Active directory is where script is.
e.g. If script is on Desktop it will make folders on Desktop. So. If you want to see what is someone doing on your PC while you are not there just put script somewhere deep in your PC and start it. Or start it everytime when PC turns on

It makes a folder in the active directory and gives it a name of the current date. It puts images for that date in the folder and gives them a name
of current time.

It is small and it was fun to make. 

Hope some of you can use it :)
