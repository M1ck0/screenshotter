# screenshotter

Takes screeshots of screen every **X seconds**, stores them in folder in the active directory.

It makes a folder in the active directory and gives it a name of the current date. It puts images for that date in the folder and gives them a name
of current time.

It is small and it was fun to make. 

Hope some of you can use it :)
